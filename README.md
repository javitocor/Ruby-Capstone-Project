# Ruby Capstone Project
This is the Ruby's Capstone project for Microverse. This project creates a web scraper built-up with Ruby

# What it does
With this program, built with Ruby, you can access data from Disney's online shop, retrieving a list of all products and their prices. You will not lose more time navigating through the website; the products are listed on your terminal and stored in a separate CSV file for each search.
